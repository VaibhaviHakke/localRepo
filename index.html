<!-- 'git init' to initilize empty repo in this local directory -->

<!-- 'git remote add origin https://github.com/VaibhaviHakke/localRepo.git' this will add remote repo(github repo) to our local repo, for this first create repo on github and don't include readme file there-->
<!-- To see on which repo we are going to make changes by using 'git remote -v' -->
<!-- 'git branch' this will show branch-->
<!-- to rename branch use 'git branch -M main'-->

<!-- If you want to work on same repo again and again then while pushing write 'git push -u origin main' instead of 'git push origin main' and from next time use only 'git push' code will be automatically pushed in origin main-->

<!-- To go from one branch to another use
'git checkout branchName' 
if branch is already not present then use 
'git checkout -b newBranchName'
To delete any branch use
'git branch -d branchName' -->
